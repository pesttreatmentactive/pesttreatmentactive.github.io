For example, the release of natural enemies may be possible in high-value specialty crops, but not in large acreage field crops. Successful insect-pest management and control are profitable.</p>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies.

Some require long-lasting contracts that cost $400 or more even though for a lot of pests, a single treatment succeeded must be adequate. When the committee understands the kinds of pests that might go into the structure and possibly damage collection products, the next step is to establish an IPPM program to address the determined requirements. </p>
