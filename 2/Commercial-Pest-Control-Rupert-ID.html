<p>The application of incorporated pest management is suggested as a sound judgment approach to pest control in all environments from residential to municipal, business and campus settings for both interior and exterior applications. Utilizing mechanical and physical controls in concert with other IPM methods keeps many types of pest damage low. Our rodent control and exemption program ensures that rodent pests not only scoot away but also can't get back in.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which enabled regional farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and use of pest control actions that will make sure beneficial economic condition, social and ecological effects 13 and applies to many farming, public health and amenity pest management scenarios.</p>

This consists of mechanical, physical, cultural, chemical and biological control of pest. A routine monitoring program is the basis of IPM decision making, despite the control strategies used.</p>
