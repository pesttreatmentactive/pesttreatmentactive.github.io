<p>Pest control is an extremely essential procedure owing to the truth that a variety of pests are providers of harmful disease-causing microorganisms. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the removal of a couple of pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).
