<p>Cockroaches are among house owners' biggest fears - the really word generates feelings of agitation and disgust. Based upon the records on making use of pesticides and on the monitoring of damaging organisms the professional user must inspect the success of the used plant protection procedures. For example, sun-loving plants are more susceptible to pests and other problems when planted in dubious locations, and vice versa. 3. Biological controls such as choosing competitive, desirable plants that make it tough for weeds to grow, or bring in helpful insects to control insect pests.</p>
