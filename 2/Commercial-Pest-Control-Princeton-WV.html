<p>A personalized post-construction and pre-construction service to control or prevent the attack from termites. The historical and more widespread use of this term is limited to utilize of natural enemies to handle populations of pest organisms. Some researchers also recognized that if regionally collaborated IPM might take place, even yearly management of a consistent pest might be made more effective (Faust and Chandler, 1998).</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which permitted regional farmers to harness their indigenous knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will make sure beneficial financial condition, ecological and social consequences 13 and is applicable to the majority of agricultural, public health and facility pest management scenarios.</p>

Knowledge of these limits and characteristics of pests and natural opponents helps to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even repair structural damage caused by termites.</p>
