<p>Biological control has actually been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest issues, classical biological control method is normally used where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has actually been effectively utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
