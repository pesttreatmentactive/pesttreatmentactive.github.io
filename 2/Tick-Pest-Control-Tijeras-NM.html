<p>The habits of the pest can be made use of for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and breeding disturbance methods (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). When distributed in the field or placed in traps, baits containing dangerous product will bring in and eliminate the pests.</p>
<p>This method of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in recent years given that fire kills advantageous insects in addition to the pests and can have a negative effect on the soil. To reduce potential damage to helpful insects, limit your spraying to little locations where you can see pests lurking, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any great bugs you can't see.</p>
