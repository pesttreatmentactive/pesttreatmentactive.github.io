<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family bug pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about reducing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management techniques are unable to keep an insect pest population below a financial limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Founded in 1967, it is the leading association of the expert pest management markets, with over 300 members throughout the country. Safety precedes for us. We only use government-approved and environmentally-friendly pesticides and products for our treatments that are safe for children and pets too.
