<p>Worldwide, more than 500 types of insects, termites, and spiders have actually established some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the form of a solid, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests prefer crops like maize, sunflower, okra (girl finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a bigger ecosystem and handles both with the big photo in mind.</p>
<p>Select an efficient management method that will have the least amount of impact on other living creatures and the environment if a pest or illness causes inappropriate damage despite preventative efforts. Examples include cultivation of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, choice of planting websites, trap crops, and adjusting the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly achieve levels at which damage is caused therefore becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare).
