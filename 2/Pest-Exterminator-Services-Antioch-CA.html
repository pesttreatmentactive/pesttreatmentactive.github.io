<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest reliable dosage when other methods of pest control have actually stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat adjustment, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>One ofthe greatest benefits of natural methods is that they do not involve making use of toxicchemicals. Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if available; remember, do not kill the useful insects. But the exterminators not just help you in eliminating the pests from your home, but they ensure the pests will not come again. IPM worries the use of non-chemical control methods, such as exclusion or trapping, prior to chemical alternatives.</p>
