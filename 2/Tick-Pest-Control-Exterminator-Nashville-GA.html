<p>Termites are such harmful pests that you want your termite treatment to result in termite extermination. As soon as action, tracking, and recognition limits suggest that pest control is required, and preventive methods are no longer effective or offered, IPM programs then examine the proper control approach both for efficiency and threat. The letter of invitation for this plenary address recommended for its title the main style of the whole Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Worldwide Reality".</p>
<p>It is also apparent from lots of conversations with growers and pest control experts in California that resistance management viewed as turning pesticides among various mode of action groups is frequently perceived as IPM, although resistance management is just a part of IPM.

If a number of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population.
