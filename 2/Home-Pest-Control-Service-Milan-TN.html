<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the ecosystem as an entire and takes into account a balanced mix of the abovementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>All at once, it is also based on semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are driven away or prevented away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are at the same time brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ). The majority of pesticide problems are brought on by a little number of the pesticides available today. </p>
