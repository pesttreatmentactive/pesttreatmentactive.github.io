Current experiences with insect pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for essential examples in the discussion. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) describes pest control and prevention programs that count on a number of simultaneous methods to obtain the wanted result.</p>
<p>In Asia, various stages of IPM have been effectively adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
