Accuracy applications of low toxicity pesticides rather than typical baseboard applications or treatment of an entire property also have actually shown to greatly reduce the overall volumes of pesticides used. Insect pests regularly have natural opponents that are helpful to the landscape.</p>

Pesticides not contained in traps or baits need to typically just be used to targeted places, not sprayed over the entire space.
