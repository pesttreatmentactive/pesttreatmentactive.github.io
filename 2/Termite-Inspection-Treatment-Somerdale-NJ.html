<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is considered as a environmentally benign and economical  pest control strategy ideally fit for both small and large farmers around the globe. As soon as termites have gotten in a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making process in which observations (from evaluation and tracking) are used to make pest control choices based on pre-determined management objectives.</p>
<p>One ofthe most significant benefits of natural approaches is that they do not include using toxicchemicals. Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if readily available; keep in mind, do not eliminate the advantageous insects. However the exterminators not only help you in removing the pests from your home, but they ensure the pests will not come again. IPM worries the use of non-chemical control techniques, such as exclusion or trapping, prior to chemical choices.</p>
