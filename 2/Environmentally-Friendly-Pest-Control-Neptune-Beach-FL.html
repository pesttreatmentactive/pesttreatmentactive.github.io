D's has actually been my only option for over 15 years for pest and weed control in addition to fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture resulting from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>Contact the U.S. EPA and your state pesticide regulatory firm with any concerns about the approval status of dicamba herbicide products for in-crop use with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend ® soybeans or products with XtendFlex ® Innovation.

IPM coordinates using pest biology, ecological details, and available technology to avoid unacceptable levels of pest damage by the most affordable ways, while reducing risk to individuals, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
<p>For that reason, pest management practices on one crop can directly or indirectly affect the other. Pest control is severe business, one that you shouldn't be managing yourself.
