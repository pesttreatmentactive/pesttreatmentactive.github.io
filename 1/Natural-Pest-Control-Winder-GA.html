To address invasive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is generally utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has actually been efficiently used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Stay watchful and call your pest control expert for a follow-up treatment if you ever see pests returning after treatment.
