<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control household bug pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically solely about minimizing pesticide usage.

<p>In West Africa, using okra as a trap crop shows gratifying results in combating bollworms and other cotton pests. There was a great deal of termite issue I was facing in the past and with this service I had the ability to control termite to a terrific extend. Hoffmann, M.P. and Frodsham, A.C. (1993) Natural Enemies of Vegetable Pest Pests. 3 disciplines, Biological Control, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and Biotechnology, have achieved specific value in our quest for better pest control techniques.</p>
<p>In general, making use of biological control is most efficient in extended cropping systems such as cut flowers and vegetables, however they are likewise being successfully utilized in short term decorative cropping systems such as annual bedding plants.
