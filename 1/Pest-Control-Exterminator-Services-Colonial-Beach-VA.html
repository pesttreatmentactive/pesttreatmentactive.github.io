<p>Chemical pest control, especially area fumigation, tends to work best for severe infestations.

<p>1. Chemical Pest Control. Pests can be big challenge to the development of your business.

IPM stresses using non-chemical control techniques, such as exemption or trapping, before chemical choices.</p>
