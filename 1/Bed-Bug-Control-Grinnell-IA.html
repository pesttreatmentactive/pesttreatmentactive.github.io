If many of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides must be used as the last option, in concept, sometimes they are the first line of defense to avoid the area-wide spread of certain endemic or invasive pests and illness or to secure the seed and transplants from common and consistent pest issues.</p>
