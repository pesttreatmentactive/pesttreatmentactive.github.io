<p>Physical and mechanical controls eliminate a pest directly, block pests out, or make the environment unsuitable for it. Traps for rodents are examples of mechanical control. After finishing the needed training, workers can provide supervised pest control services. Using physical barriers such as row covers or trenches avoids insects from reaching the crop.</p>

If they can not enter it, pests can not endure without food and will not infest a structure. Another method involves utilizing baits that either damage the pests or prevent them from replicating.
