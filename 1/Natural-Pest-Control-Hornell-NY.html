<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest reliable dose when other methods of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that focuses on long-lasting prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of methods such as biological control, habitat control, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>The benefits of Integrated Pest Management are immense directly to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control involves using living organisms to control a pest population. Do not blend pesticides. There are 4 significant components in the new IPM model that resolve numerous pest management choices, the knowledge, and resources the grower has to address the pest concern, planning and organization of details to take suitable management actions, and preserving great communication to distribute and obtain knowledge about pests and their management.</p>
<p>Pests can damage specimen labels, cushioning, drawers and cabinets that are vital for the appropriate care of geological collections.

A third technique to biological control includes enhancing natural enemies through rearing and regular releases and can be inoculative (natural enemies are launched early in the season) or innundative (natural enemies are released as a biological pesticide). </p>
