Integrated Pest Management or IPM, as it is commonly known, is a system of managing pests which is developed to be sustainable.</p>
<p>If a pest or disease triggers unacceptable damage in spite of preventative efforts, select an efficient management approach that will have the least quantity of effect on other living creatures and the environment. Examples include growing of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, choice of planting websites, trap crops, and changing the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is caused hence becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a rich neighborhood likely will have a lot of big, costly homes, so pest control costs might be greater there because there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those homes. </p>
