The Indian Pest Control Association (IPCA) is a non-profit trade association of expert pest management companies in India. Chemical control usually refers to using synthetic chemical pesticides (Pimental 2009 ). Nevertheless, to be technically precise, chemical control ought to consist of synthetic chemicals as well as chemicals of botanical or microbial origin.</p>

<p>Otherwise, their effectiveness is prone to neutralization by resistance in the very same way similar to pesticides. The use of low-volume spray equipment decreases total pesticide usage and labor expense. This likewise made it simple to track numerous centers and allowed for more timely restorative actions and more targeted pest-control treatments. Called wood-eating insects, termites are among the worst pests to encounter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses much of the same principles as IPM but limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of artificial chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides. </p>
