If standard home health is neglected, the results of other types of pest control will be incredibly temporary as the pests will soon be back, and in greater numbers.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in an organic system are as harmful to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides.
