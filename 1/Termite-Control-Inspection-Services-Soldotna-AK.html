<p>Pests controlled: Use horticultural oils to fight aphids, termites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals must be used only as a last resort, after mechanical, cultural, and biological methods have actually been attempted and revealed ineffective. Various pest control chemicals are toxic and could be harmful, if not used appropriately.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and determine them precisely, so that suitable control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds.
