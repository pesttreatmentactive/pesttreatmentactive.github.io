<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and a few of the pesticides used in a natural system are as hazardous to people and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control specialists can only do so much to protect the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The reality is, food business operators need to take an active role in incorporated pest management by working closely with the experts.</p>
<p>Integrate row covers with crop rotation if you're dealing with pests that overwinter in the soil. For pest control, temperature level needs to be 68 ° F or lower, and relative humidity must be kept below an optimum of 70%; nevertheless, maintaining climate conditions suggested for the preservation of books and paper will help to control insect populations. For instance, feeding activities of specific caterpillars on the leaves of potatoes and tomatoes cause a systemic production of protease inhibitors revealed throughout the plant that hinder the food digestion procedure and feeding habits of insects (36 ).</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production applies many of the very same concepts as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides. </p>
<p>And because pests act in a different way even within a types, controlling them efficiently requires special knowledge of the pests themselves, as well as ways to safely and efficientlymanage them. Essential documents consist of a scope of service, pest activity reports, service reports, restorative action reports, trap design maps, lists of authorized pesticides, pesticide usage reports and applicator licenses.</p>
