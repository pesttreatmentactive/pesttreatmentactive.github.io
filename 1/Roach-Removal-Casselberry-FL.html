A single spotting of any pest in a storage facility during an audit can suggest a great deal of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your possessions with harmful chemicals, ruin the air quality in your home or business, possibly infect food and other perishables, and only kills pests at the surface of the issue.</p>

In some areas, where agricultural land remains in scarcity or there is a constant need for specialized crops, certain IPM practices such as allocating space for natural enemy environments or crop rotation are not constantly possible.</p>
<p>We traditionally have actually sold nature short, both in its ability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of environmentally unsound methods along with its array of inherent strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, pressures of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have actually been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thus increasing the likelihood that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>In Asia, different phases of IPM have actually been effectively adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997). </p>

After executing any pest management tactic, inspect the indicator plants to assess if arthropod pests have been eliminated and evaluate the effectiveness and durability of control.</p>
